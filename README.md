- Just below the "Solidity Compiler" button, find and use the "Deploy and Run transactions" button to deploy the smart contract
- On successful deployment, find and click on the "Deployed Contracts" heading to see a drop down of an interface through which the contract can be interacted with
- Find the provided test accounts under the "ACCOUNTS" field of the interface on the left
- Copy any of the addresses listed in the format 0x5B3...eddC4 (100 ether) for use as input to the interfaces that require an address when interacting with the contract
- Test interact with the various functions of the smart contract to see the error handling implementations in action.
